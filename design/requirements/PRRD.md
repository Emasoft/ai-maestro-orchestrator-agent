# Project Requirements & Rules — ai-maestro-orchestrator-agent

ORCHESTRATOR role plugin (AMOA) — task distribution, kanban, red-column management.

## §0. Canonical source + copies

| Path | Role | Update strategy |
|---|---|---|
| `design/requirements/PRRD.md` | **CANONICAL** for this project | Edit first. Bump `prrd-version:`. Update `updated:`. |

## §I. How to read this document

Rule citation form: `PRRD G<n>.<v>` (golden, user-set) or `PRRD S<n>.<v>`
(silver, manager-mutable). Rule numbers are globally unique across G/S;
promote/demote flips the letter without changing the number. The
`get-prrd.py <n>` script returns a rule's text by bare number. Full
spec: `~/.claude/rules/prrd-design-rules.md`.

## 🥇 GOLDEN — set by the USER (immutable to MANAGER)

- **G1.1** — Every agent that writes to GitHub (issue, issue comment, PR, PR comment, PR review, discussion, release note) MUST begin the body with a one-line self-identification of which agent/role/plugin authored it, because all AI Maestro agents share the single human-owner GitHub identity (the owner's gh CLI auth). Recommended leading line: _Posted by the Claude developing **<plugin-or-role>** (via the shared @owner gh auth)._ Commit messages SHOULD carry an `Agent: <role>` trailer.

## 🥈 SILVER — MANAGER-mutable (agents propose via COS)
