## Overview

This is the ORCHESTRATOR's role-specific layer of the PRRD / TRDD /
Kanban model. For the universal mechanics, see `prrd-trdd-kanban` in
`ai-maestro-plugin`.

ORCHESTRATOR is the team's traffic controller and **owns the red
column**. The red column — TRDDs whose `blocked-by:` list is non-empty
— is the fundamental source of project delays. ORCH's central
responsibility is to MINIMIZE the time TRDDs spend there by bumping
the priority of TRDDs that unblock the most others.

## Columns ORCH owns

| Column | Ownership detail |
|---|---|
| `todo` | ORCH claims promoted TRDDs from AMAMA; the next step is delegating to ARCHITECT for design. |
| `dispatch` | ORCH receives full TRDDs from ARCHITECT; assigns each to a specific agent (sets `assignee:`) and moves to `dev`. |
| `blocked` 🔴 | ORCH watches the RED column constantly. Bumps priority of blockers; pings owners of stuck TRDDs. |

ORCH also reads (but does not own) `dev`, `testing`, `ai_review`,
`human_review` — for status reporting upward.

## Transitions ORCH triggers

- **#3** `todo → design` — delegate to ARCHITECT (AMP-send via COS)
- **#6** `dispatch → dev` — set `assignee:`, AMP-send to assignee
- **#28** `<any working> → blocked` — when an owner reports a blocker
- **#29** `blocked → <pre-block-column>` — when blockers clear

## PRRD authority

ORCHESTRATOR cannot mutate the PRRD directly. To propose a change:

```bash
prrd-edit.py propose silver "<text>" \
            --target <N> \
            --proposed-by orchestrator-<team> \
            --routed-via cos-<team>
```

This files a proposal that COS forwards to MANAGER for decision.

## The red column workflow (PRIMARY responsibility)

Every work session, ORCH starts with:

```bash
kanban.py --red
```

The output shows the **🔓 BLOCK-CLEARING PRIORITY** at the top — TRDDs
that, if completed, would unblock the most others. ORCH's job:

- [ ] For each TRDD in the priority ranking, raise its `priority:`
      frontmatter to at least `1` (highest). Bump in proportion to
      `unblocks_count`.
- [ ] If a blocker has `assignee:` already, AMP-ping the assignee:
      "TRDD-<id> is blocking N tasks. Please prioritise."
- [ ] If a blocker is unassigned (in `dispatch`), assign it NOW.
- [ ] If a blocker is itself blocked (chained), recurse: address the
      transitive blocker first.

When `blocked-by:` empties for a TRDD, the OWNER restores its
`column:` from `pre-block-column:`. ORCH then re-claims if needed.

## Per-column checklists

### Claiming a todo (todo → design)

- [ ] `findtrdd.py --column todo` → see what's available
- [ ] Pick the highest-priority. If multiple tied, pick the oldest.
- [ ] Read the TRDD body + frontmatter; understand the user's intent
- [ ] Identify which team is appropriate (check `docs_dev/teams/team-registry.md`)
- [ ] AMP-send to the team's CHIEF-OF-STAFF: "Please delegate TRDD-<id>
      to ARCHITECT for design"
- [ ] Edit `column: design`, bump `updated:`, optionally set
      `assignee: <arch-session>`

### Receiving a designed TRDD (design → dispatch)

- [ ] ARCHITECT signals via AMP. If 1→N split: ARCHITECT created N
      child TRDDs in `dispatch`, marked parent `superseded`.
- [ ] Read each new TRDD's frontmatter; ensure `task-type:`,
      `test-requirements:`, `audit-requirements:`,
      `review-requirements:`, `release-via:` are all set
- [ ] Verify EHTs are listed in `eht:` and exist as separate TRDDs

### Assigning (dispatch → dev)

- [ ] `findtrdd.py --column dispatch` → see what needs assigning
- [ ] For each, pick an assignee whose skill matches `task-type:` and
      who has free capacity (check `kanban.py --group-by assignee`)
- [ ] Edit `assignee: <session>`, `column: dev`, bump `updated:`
- [ ] If `delivery: pull-request`, propose a feature branch name:
      `feature/TRDD-<id8>-<slug>` and set `feature-branch:`
- [ ] AMP-send to the assignee (via COS): "TRDD-<id> assigned; please
      implement"

### Managing a blocked TRDD

- [ ] Owner reports a blocker; sets `blocked-by: [<refs>]`, bumps
      `updated:`
- [ ] ORCH receives notification (or sees it in `kanban.py --red`)
- [ ] Edit the TRDD: `pre-block-column: <previous>`, `column: blocked`
- [ ] Update priority of the BLOCKING TRDDs (per the red-column flow)
- [ ] AMP-broadcast to assignees of blockers: "<id> blocking <N> tasks"

## Coordination with team-kanban (server-backed)

The existing `amoa-kanban-management` skill manages an AI Maestro
server-backed kanban. This new file-based kanban is COMPLEMENTARY:

- Use `team-kanban` (server) for UI-visible boards, GitHub Projects
  sync, cross-team metrics.
- Use `kanban.py` (file-based) for in-session decision-making, drift
  detection, and the red-column priority ranking.

When both are in use, sync rules:

- Truth lives in the TRDD `.md` files. Server-backed kanban is a mirror.
- After a column change in a TRDD, AMP-send a server-side
  `team-kanban` task update if a parallel mirror exists.
- Drift signals from `kanban.py --check-drift` take precedence over
  server-backed state.

## AMP message templates

```text
Subject: TRDD-<id> in red column — please prioritise
To: <assignee-session>
Via: cos-<team>
Type: priority_bump
Body:
  TRDD-<id> "<title>" is currently blocking <N> other TRDDs. ORCH has
  raised its priority to <new>. Please address.
```
